			<h1>Extra features</h1>
		</header>
		<main>
			<p>This document describes some extra features not present in the original version of the applets
			and not described in the original <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00560">publication</a>.
			The extensions are enabled by appending <span class="ext_codeword">?ext</span> to the page URLs.
			Once applied, all intra-site links are updated to include it,
			and it can and should be saved in any bookmarks.
			It is included in the links on this page.</p>
			
			<p>When the extensions are not enabled, the applets behave exactly like the original version
			except for the short paragraph about the extensions.</p>
			
			<h2>Decade shift</h2>
			
			<p>The decade shift setting can be used to shift the ranges of all sliders and graph axes
			by integer orders of magnitude. These happen to cancel each other out so that there is no visual change
			in the graphs other than the numbers on axes and possible data points.
			Possible values are between &minus;9 and +4 inclusive.
			This feature was added to allow going to smaller concentrations than 10<sup>&minus;9</sup>&nbsp;mol&nbsp;l<sup>&minus;1</sup>
			while complicating the applet as little as possible.</p>
			
			<h2>Precise iterative search</h2>
			
			<p>A calculation method similar to the iterative search, this attempts to converge to a least squares fit
			without being restricted to the discrete values of the sliders and thus gives much more precise results.
			In consequence, if the initial values are far from a good fit, arriving to a least squares solution
			requires a large number of iterations. The algorithm is implemented using recursion,
			and it fails if it fills the stack before converging.
			Therefore, it is recommended to use one of the other calculation methods first and then run this.
			(I might fix this issue in the future.)</p>
			
			<p>Once a least squares fit is found, the values of the optimised parameters (but not the slider positions)
			are adjusted accordingly. The result is displayed in a pop-up dialog.
			If there are more data points than free parameters, estimates of standard errors and
			uncertainties with a 95% level of confidence are calculated for each free parameter.
			The estimates are reasonably accurate only if they are relatively small
			or, in other words, when relative uncertainties are much less than 100%.
			It is impossible to give universally applicable guidelines on how small they should be,
			but generally if relative uncertainties are greater than 100%,
			the results are probably not worth reporting.</p>
			
			<h2>Logarithmic residuals</h2>
			
			<p>In the original version, least squares fit always calculated residuals by taking the difference
			between theoretical and experimental (data point) values. With this option enabled, the differences
			of their logarithms are calculated instead. This usually produces a visually better fit into data points
			when using a logarithmic (absolute) vertical scale.
			Whether this is valid to do should be taken into consideration, however.</p>
			
			<h2>Other small fixes</h2>
			
			<p>There were some inconsistent axis limits that were left in the original version by mistake.
			Specifically, the lower limit of the logarithmic vertical axis in competing ligands and competing receptors simulations
			is 10<sup>&minus;10</sup> instead of 10<sup>&minus;12</sup>.
			This is fixed when extensions are enabled.</p>
