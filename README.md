Little Sims of Binding Curves

This little repository is a collection of little simulations of binding curves.

This applet implementation is shamelessly copying from an [ACS Omega paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.2c00560) as my own copy to modify and add on other simulations as needed. 
The underlying simulation solving for the quadratic and cubic functions are my own implementation 
to finding the roots.

The applet allows for the following conditions to be simulated so far: 
1. Protein-ligand binding (A quadratic form)
2. Two ligands competing with one another for the same binding site (a cubic form)
3. Two proteins competing to bind the same ligand
4. Two proteins dimerizing
